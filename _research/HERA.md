The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is an experiment to detect spatial 
fluctuations of the hydrogen signature during Cosmic Dawn and EoR. Instead of the 
global average that EDGES takes, HERA can see how the signal varies over the sky — 
potentially even building a 3D ‘map’ of the temperature! HERA is a mid-size 
collaboration spanning multiple universities in the US and some in Europe and South 
Africa. The telescope itself is an array (i.e. multiple low-frequency radio dishes 
joined together) located in the desert in South Africa.
