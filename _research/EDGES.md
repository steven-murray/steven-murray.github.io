The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signal is a focused experiment that aims to 
detect the “global” signal from neutral hydrogen during the CD/EoR. It measures a 
single frequency spectrum averaged over the whole sky. This traces the total temperature
 of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as it evolves throughout cosmic time. The three 
 distinct antennas deployed by EDGES cover redshifts between 6 — 27, or from 
 7.7 — 13.3 billion years ago.
