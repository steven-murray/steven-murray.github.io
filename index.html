    G’day! I’m an astrophysics postdoctoral researcher at 
    <a href="http://loco.lab.asu.edu/"">ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.</a>
</p>


<p>
    I use data from some of the largest radio telescopes in the world to search for the
    characteristic imprint of the first stars, galaxies and black holes in the Universe.

    of science I do, check out <a href="cosmic-dawn/">this page about Cosmic Dawn</a>.

<p>
    The kind of science I do is heavily dependent on computer programs. I have become
    passionate about writing good code that can be reused by the community. Check out
    my <a href="code/">code page</a> to see some of the software projects I've worked on.
