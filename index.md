I'm a postdoctoral researcher at ASU's 
<a href="http://sese.asu.edu" data-type="URL" data-id="http://sese.asu.edu">School of Earth and Space Exploration</a>. 

My research focus is the current great chasm in our knowledge of the evolving Universe -- 
the epochs spanning from the first light we can see in the CMB, through the following 
Dark Ages, into the Cosmic Dawn in which the first stars fired up, and through the Epoch
of Reionization, in which the vast sea of neutral hydrogen gas between the forming 
galaxies was ionized -- the last great phase transition of the Universe. These epochs,
beginning just 379,000 years into the Universe's 14 billion year history, and ending 
almost 6 billion years later, are key to answering many questions we have about how stars 
and galaxies form and evolve, and also about the background Dark Matter that sets the 
structures in place.

With my many colleagues, I use massive low-frequency radio telescopes like 
<a href="http://reionization.org">HERA</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.mwatelescope.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mwatelescope.org/">MWA</a> 
to attempt to detect an extremely faint (but thoroughly pervasive) signal emitted by the 
neutral hydrogen during the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization. It's tough work, but 
the reward will be great!

I'm also super interested in statistics (mostly Bayesian), scientific and open-source 
code (mostly Python, but C, Fortran and web technologies get a look-in too), and
mathematical modelling. Check out my pages for details!
