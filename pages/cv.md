Check out my [https://steven-murray.github.io/downloads/cv.pdf](CV as a pdf). I try to
keep it updated every ~month.

See a configurable list of my publications on [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0003-3059-3823&amp;sort=citation_count_norm%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;p_=0](ADS).
 (this is auto-generated from my ORCID), or on [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zzGGzkkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en](Google Scholar)

I also try to keep my [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Murray2](ResearchGate)
account reasonably up-to-date, though it is a far less useful place to get information
on my publication record.
