I grew up in rural Queensland, Australia. I was interested in science -- and especially
the biggest questions -- from a young age. Thanks to my parents for that!

My secondary education was at (Matthew Flinders Anglican College)[https://mfac.edu.au].

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the (University of Queensland)[https://www.uq.edu.au/]
majoring in mathematics and minoring in physics.

I moved to Western Australia to complete my honours thesis project at (UWA)[https://www.uwa.edu.au],
with (Prof. John Harnett)[https://peoplepill.com/people/john-hartnett-2]. This project
focussed on determining the 2-point correlation function of galaxies in the SDSS and GAMA
surveys.

Between UQ and UWA I took a year off to get to know (and marry!) my wonderful wife
Jeanette. It wasn't long before we became a family of five. Our three kids Emily, 
Joshua and Caleb have been an immense joy and source of energy throughout the whole adventure.

I commenced my PhD at UWA with supervisors (Chris Power)[https://www.icrar.org/people/cpower/]
and (Aaron Robotham)[https://www.icrar.org/people/arobotham/].
My (PhD thesis)[https://zenodo.org/record/495509] focussed on dark matter and large-scale
structures in the Universe -- broadly following on from my honours thesis. 
Throughout the PhD I developed several computational tools for calculating dark matter
halo mass functions and halo model statistics. 
The evolution of this work has become a web-application at https://thehalomod.app.

Following my PhD, I transitioned into radio astronomy, specifically Epoch of 
Reionization and Cosmic Dawn, in a postdoc position with (Prof. Cath Trott)[https://www.icrar.org/people/ctrott/]
at another Western Australian university -- (Curtin)[https://www.curtin.edu.au/].
There, I focussed on the interface of theory and observation, deriving statistical 
models of what observations can really tell us about the signal we seek from the early
Universe.

I continue that line of work now at (Arizona State University)[https://asu.edu] in 
the (Low-Frequency Cosmology group)[http://loco.lab.asu.edu/]. 

My main interests are in validating our observational pipelines via simulation and 
statistical models, and developing high-performance cosmological reionization codes.
I am an avid Python programmer, and have written many full-fledged pieces of software
to enable cosmological analysis and prediction. I am also an open-source advocate, 
having published several pieces of code in the (Journal of Open Source Software)[https://joss.theoj.org/].
