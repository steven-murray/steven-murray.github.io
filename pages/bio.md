> **Note:** For my in-depth technical bio, see my <a href="cv/">CV</a>.

I was born and raised in Australia, and did high-school 
at [Matthew Flinders Anglican College](https://mfac.edu.au), where I was Dux of the
class of 2006.

My undergraduate degree is from the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/),
with a major in maths and physics.

I moved to Western Australia to complete my honours thesis project at [UWA](https://www.uwa.edu.au),
with [Prof. John Harnett](https://peoplepill.com/people/john-hartnett-2). 
My thesis was titled "Large-Scale Structure in the SDSS and GAMA Surveys" and looked at
some novel applications of the two-point correlation function of galaxies in these two
optical galaxy surveys. 

I obtained my PhD at UWA with supervisors [Chris Power](https://www.icrar.org/people/cpower/)
and [Aaron Robotham](https://www.icrar.org/people/arobotham/).
My [PhD thesis](https://zenodo.org/record/495509) focussed on dark matter and large-scale
structures in the Universe -- broadly following on from my honours thesis. 
Throughout the PhD I developed several computational tools for calculating dark matter
halo mass functions and halo model statistics. 
The evolution of this work has become a web-application at https://thehalomod.app.

Following my PhD, I transitioned into radio astronomy, specifically 21cm cosmology, 
in a postdoc position with [Prof. Cath Trott](https://www.icrar.org/people/ctrott/)
at [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au/).
There, I focussed on the interface of theory and observation, deriving statistical 
models of what observations can really tell us about the signal we seek from the early
Universe.

I continue that line of work now at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu) in 
the [Low-Frequency Cosmology group](http://loco.lab.asu.edu/), where as a Research
Scientist, I am involved in several world-leading experiments (including HERA and EDGES),
as well as contributing to the next generation by training the many undergraduate and
postgraduate students in our lab. One highlight in this regard is the annual HERA 
"<a href="https://github.com/hera-team/champ_bootcamp">CHAMP</a>" bootcamp, at which
I have taught (Python and Reionization theory) for several years, and served as chair
of the curriculum development committee in 2022.

My main interests are in validating our observational pipelines via simulation and 
statistical models, and developing high-performance cosmological reionization codes.
I am an avid open-source programmer, and have written many full-fledged pieces of software
to enable cosmological analysis and prediction. I have published several codes in the 
[Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).
