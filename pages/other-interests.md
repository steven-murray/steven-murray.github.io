I’m a fairly keen musician, having played piano throughout my life. I can listen to most
genres with interest, though I have a special fondness for Romantic-period solo piano 
(especially Chopin), brass band music (I was in a brass band for several years, playing 
percussion), and progressive metal/rock (favourite band: Neal Morse Band).

I have taught piano to young students since I was 15. At the moment, I’m teaching my own 
children, which is great fun!

I also like creative writing. I haven’t done a whole lot of it in my adult life, though 
I still write the occasional poem. I did write a tongue-in-cheek ‘epic’ for a research 
talk I once gave. In terms of literature, I can’t say I’m particularly sophisticated; my 
favourites include anything Tolkien (especially the Silmarillion), C.S. Lewis (especially 
Narnia and his philosophical/religious works), the Bible, The Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan) 
and anything by Brandon Sanderson.

In terms of sports, I always had a fondness for cricket. I played consistently from when 
I was seven til seventeen, typically as a medium-fast right-hand bowler (typically opener 
or first-change).
