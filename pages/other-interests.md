I’m a fairly keen musician, having played piano throughout my life. I can listen to most
genres with interest, though I have a special fondness for Romantic-period solo piano 
(especially Chopin), brass band music (I was in a brass band for several years, playing 
percussion), and progressive metal/rock (Neal Morse Band, Dream Theater, Theocracy, ...).

I also like creative writing. I haven’t done a whole lot of it in my adult life, though 
I still write the occasional poem. I did write a tongue-in-cheek ‘epic’ for a research 
talk I once gave. 
In terms of literature, I go in for good fantasy; anything Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, The Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan), the Wingfeather Saga, and anything by Brandon Sanderson.

As far as sport goes, I've been a fan of cricket and rugby league since I was a kid.
