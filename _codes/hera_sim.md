hera_sim is one of the primary codes I contribute to in the HERA software suite. It is 
geared at simulating HERA-specific instrumental effects (thermal noise, cross-coupling, 
cable reflections) and injecting them into simulated visibilities.

This code is central to validating HERA's analysis pipeline (as discussed in the linked paper).
