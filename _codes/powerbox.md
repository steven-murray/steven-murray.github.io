A small Python code that is all about power spectra in “boxes” of arbitrary 
dimension. It can both create boxes with a given power spectrum, or determine the power 
spectrum of a given box. It does all of this with a lot of generality — we’re not just 
talking about 2- or 3-dimensional boxes, but boxes with an arbitrary number of dimensions 
(as long as your computer has enough memory!). Bring on the 5-dimensional cubes!
