I am the primary developer of a new software pipeline for EDGES data. This involves 
<a href="https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io">data reading/writing</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-cal">calibration</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis">analysis</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-estimate">parameter estimation</a>.

The software is developed by a small team, and I am overseeing (and contributing to) the 
development, in order to transform the EDGES analysis pipeline into something that is 
highly transparent, reproducible and accurate.
