A python application that provides a flexible and simple way to calculate the 
Halo Mass Function for a range of varying parameters.

The Halo Mass Function is a critical quantity in determining 
properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. It encodes the number of halos 
of a given mass in a given volume of the Universe, and can be predicted from some 
neat arguments given a cosmology that describes how the Universe is 
expanding. The predictions can be used to compare to observations of galaxy clusters to 
determine parameters of the large scale structure. The HMF is also a key ingredient in 
more complex predictions of the Universe, via the <a href="https://github.com/halomod/halomod">halo model</a>.
