<a href="https://thehalomod.app">TheHaloMod</a> is a web-application that uses my Python codes <a href="https://gitub.com/halomod/hmf">hmf</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/halomod/halomod">halomod</a> to 
calculate halo model quantities, and serve up plots directly without ever having to 
install the codes, from the comfort of your web browser.

The purpose of `TheHaloMod` is to be useful both for researchers and also students approaching
 research into large-scale structure. `TheHaloMod` was formerly known as `HMFcalc`, 
and has been well-used since its creation in 2013. `TheHaloMod` adds extra goodies to 
the original `HMFcalc` â€” namely, the ability to calculate correlation functions and 
power spectra of galaxies.

From June 2021, TheHaloMod has become a shiny new single-page app, developed by a very
talented group of Computer Science undergrads at ASU.
